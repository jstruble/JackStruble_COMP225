===================
I started off this class behind on reading and on experience.
I have all but finished making up the reading, but there is still much about Android that I do not understand,
mostly having to do with the underpinnings of each app.
I can find the code that prescribes most of the components of the Sudoku app that I can see,
all the buttons, etc., but there is still a lot of code whose function is unclear to me.
At this point, I could modify existing elements of the Sudoku app, 
but could not create it or something similar from scratch and probably would not be able to add much.
This also means that I would not be able to write an entirely new program since,
while I understand more than enough Java to write something, 
there appears to be more underlying any app than I understand at the moment,
and I would not be able to duplicate that functional bit.
Speaking of Java, I have more than enough of a grasp of Java to understand the parts of apps written with it,
but XML is still an unknown.
My impression of the class itself is that developing for Android is much more complex than simply writing code,
but that it has a much more obviously practical payoff.
Github is still being uncooperative, and does not show anything I try to Push to it.
